# Sauce Labs MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides comprehensive integration with Sauce Labs testing platform. This 
server enables AI assistants (LLM clients) to interact with Sauce Labs' device cloud, manage test jobs, analyze builds, 
and monitor testing infrastructure directly through natural language conversations.

## Features

### üöÄ **Core Capabilities**
- **Account Management**: View account details, team information, and user permissions
- **Device Cloud Access**: Browse 300+ real devices (iOS, Android) and virtual machines
- **Test Job Management**: Retrieve recent jobs, analyze test results, and debug failures
- **Build Monitoring**: Track build status, view job collections, and analyze test suites
- **Storage Management**: Manage uploaded apps and test artifacts
- **Tunnel Monitoring**: Check Sauce Connect tunnel status and configuration

### üîß **Advanced Features**
- **Real-time Device Status**: Monitor device availability and usage across data centers
- **Cross-platform Testing**: Support for both Virtual Device Cloud (VDC) and Real Device Cloud (RDC)
- **Test Analytics**: Detailed job information including logs, videos, and performance metrics
- **Team Collaboration**: Multi-team support with proper access controls

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- `pip`
- Sauce Labs account with API access
- Gemini CLI, Claude Desktop, Goose, or other LLM Client

### For Claude Desktop (Mac/Linux) or Gemini CLI 

1. **Install the MCP server and download the launch script**:

    ```bash
    pip install sauce-api-mcp
   
    curl -o ~/sauce-mcp-launcher.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saucelabs/sauce-api-mcp/refs/heads/main/sauce-mcp-launcher.sh
    chmod +x ~/sauce-mcp-launcher.sh
    ```
 
2. **Configure the Client**:
   
    Edit the config file:

***Claude***

    `~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

***Gemini CLI***

   `~/.gemini/settings.json`

3. **Add the Sauce Labs MCP server configuration**:

    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "sauce-labs": {
        "command": "/path/to/tmp/sauce-mcp-launcher.sh",
          "env": {
            "SAUCE_USERNAME": "your-sauce-username",
            "SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY": "your-sauce-access-key"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```
 
   ***Note: if you configure SAUCE_USERNAME and SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY as environment variables, you won't need to add them to the config block. 

4. **Restart the client to load the new MCP server.**

#### [Goose](https://block.github.io/goose/)

First, install the MCP Server from `pip`, and download the launch script:

   ```bash
       pip install sauce-api-mcp
      
       curl -o ~/sauce-mcp-launcher.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saucelabs/sauce-api-mcp/refs/heads/main/sauce-mcp-launcher.sh
       chmod +x ~/sauce-mcp-launcher.sh
   ```

Within your `~/.config/goose/config.yaml` file, add the following extension:

  ```bash
  sauce-api-mcp:
    args: []
    bundled: null
    cmd: /<path>/sauce-mcp-launcher.sh
    description: Sauce Labs MCP for API
    enabled: true
    env_keys: []
    envs: {}
    name: sauce-api-mcp
    timeout: 10
    type: stdio
```
Be sure to edit the <path> to reflect your launch script location.

#### Now you can ask questions like:
* "Show me my recent test failures"
* "Find available iPhone devices for testing"
* "Analyze the performance of my latest build"

## Configuration ##
### Required Environment Variables ###
- SAUCE_USERNAME: Your Sauce Labs username
- SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY: Your Sauce Labs access key (found in Account Settings)

### Optional Configuration ###

SAUCE_REGION: Sauce Labs data center region (default: us-west-1)

# Getting Your Sauce Labs Credentials #

1. Log into your Sauce Labs account
2. Navigate to Account ‚Üí User Settings
3. Copy your Username and Access Key
4. Add these to your Claude Desktop configuration

### Usage Examples ###
Once configured, you can interact with Sauce Labs through natural language in Claude Desktop:

```
"Show me all available iPhone devices"
"What Android devices are currently in use?"
"Find me a Samsung Galaxy S24 for testing"
```
#### Test Job Analysis
```
"Show me my recent test jobs"

Check that all dependencies are installed

### "Authentication failed"

Verify your SAUCE_USERNAME and SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY are correct
Ensure credentials have proper permissions for the requested operations
Check that your Sauce Labs account is active

Verify your account has access to the device cloud
Check your team's device allocation settings
Ensure you're querying the correct data center region

### "Job not found"

Verify the job ID is correct and belongs to your account
Check if the job is from VDC vs RDC (different endpoints)
Ensure the job hasn't expired due to retention policies

# Roadmap

This roadmap outlines our vision and priorities for the project. It's a living document, and we welcome feedback and contributions from the
community! While we aim to follow this plan, priorities can change based on user feedback and new opportunities.

Want to help? We'd love to have you!

* Check out our **CONTRIBUTING.md** (CONTRIBUTING.md) guide.
* Find an existing issue in our **Issue Tracker** (../issues) that interests you.
* Have a new idea? **Open a new issue** (../issues/new/choose) to discuss it with us.

## üéØ Short-Term (Next 1-3 Months)
Our immediate focus is on enhancing the core developer experience and improving context management.

## Resources & Tools - Optimizing Model Calls
* Description: Implement Resources comprehensively for model responses. For some prompts, this will reduce latency and cost by returning a
cached result instead of making a new API call.
* Status: Planning

üöÄ Mid-Term (3-6 Months)

We plan to focus on adding API endpoints and improving overall interaction with the LLM. We will also maintain the Server to keep up with changes to 
the Sauce Labs API, and to add new product lines as they are introduced.


# Changelog
## v1.0.0
