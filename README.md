# Sauce Labs MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides comprehensive integration with Sauce Labs testing platform. This 
server enables AI assistants (LLM clients) to interact with Sauce Labs' device cloud, manage test jobs, analyze builds, 
and monitor testing infrastructure directly through natural language conversations.

## Features

### 🚀 **Core Capabilities**
- **Account Management**: View account details, team information, and user permissions
- **Device Cloud Access**: Browse 300+ real devices (iOS, Android) and virtual machines
- **Test Job Management**: Retrieve recent jobs, analyze test results, and debug failures
- **Build Monitoring**: Track build status, view job collections, and analyze test suites
- **Storage Management**: Manage uploaded apps and test artifacts
- **Tunnel Monitoring**: Check Sauce Connect tunnel status and configuration

### 🔧 **Advanced Features**
- **Real-time Device Status**: Monitor device availability and usage across data centers
- **Cross-platform Testing**: Support for both Virtual Device Cloud (VDC) and Real Device Cloud (RDC)
- **Test Analytics**: Detailed job information including logs, videos, and performance metrics
- **Team Collaboration**: Multi-team support with proper access controls

## Installation

In all instances, you'll need to rename `start_server.sh.template` to `start_server.sh`, and replace the `/path/to/sauce-api-mcp`
to the correct absolute path in your environment.

1. **Install Claude Code**:
   ```bash
   # Install Claude Code (if not already installed)
   curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/claude-code/install.sh | sh
   ```
   
2. Install the Sauce Labs MCP server:

bash# Clone and install the MCP server
git clone https://github.com/saucelabs/sauce-api-mcp.git
cd sauce-api-mcp
pip install -e .

3. Configure LLM Client:

#### [Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code)
Create or edit your Claude Code configuration:
bash# Create config directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p ~/.config/claude-code

code ~/.config/claude-code/config.json

Add the Sauce Labs MCP server configuration:
json{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sauce-labs": {
      "command": "sauce-api-mcp.git",
      "env": {
        "SAUCE_USERNAME": "your-sauce-username",
        "SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY": "your-sauce-access-key"
      }
    }
  }
}

#### [Goose](https://block.github.io/goose/)

Within your `~/.config/goose/config.yaml` file, add the following extension:

  ```bash
  sauce-api-mcp:
    args: []
    bundled: null
    cmd: /<path>/sauce-api-mcp/start_server.sh
    description: Sauce Labs MCP for API
    enabled: true
    env_keys: []
    envs: {}
    name: sauce-api-mcp
    timeout: 10
    type: stdio
```

## Troubleshooting
### Common Issues

### "MCP server not found"

Ensure the path to the MCP server executable is correct
Verify Python is installed and accessible
Check that all dependencies are installed

### "Authentication failed"

Verify your SAUCE_USERNAME and SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY are correct
Ensure credentials have proper permissions for the requested operations
Check that your Sauce Labs account is active

### "No devices found"

Verify your account has access to the device cloud
Check your team's device allocation settings
Ensure you're querying the correct data center region

### "Job not found"

Verify the job ID is correct and belongs to your account
Check if the job is from VDC vs RDC (different endpoints)
Ensure the job hasn't expired due to retention policies

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging by setting environment variables:

    {
      "env": {
        "SAUCE_USERNAME": "your-username",
        "SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY": "your-access-key",
      }
    }

# Roadmap

This roadmap outlines our vision and priorities for the project. It's a living document, and we welcome feedback and contributions from the
community! While we aim to follow this plan, priorities can change based on user feedback and new opportunities.

Want to help? We'd love to have you!

* Check out our **CONTRIBUTING.md** (CONTRIBUTING.md) guide.
* Find an existing issue in our **Issue Tracker** (../issues) that interests you.
* Have a new idea? **Open a new issue** (../issues/new/choose) to discuss it with us.

## 🎯 Short-Term (Next 1-3 Months)
Our immediate focus is on enhancing the core developer experience and improving context management.

## Resources & Tools - Optimizing Model Calls
* Description: Implement Resources comprehensively for model responses. For some prompts, this will reduce latency and cost by returning a
cached result instead of making a new API call.
* Status: Planning

🚀 Mid-Term (3-6 Months)

We plan to focus on adding API endpoints and improving overall interaction with the LLM. We will also maintain the Server to keep up with changes to 
the Sauce Labs API, and to add new product lines as they are introduced.
