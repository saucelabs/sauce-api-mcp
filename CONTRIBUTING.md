# üöÄ Setting Up Your Development Environment

## Create a Virtual Environment

We strongly recommend using a virtual environment to manage project dependencies. This isolates your project's packages from your global
Python installation.



    # Create a virtual environment
    python3 -m venv .venv
    
    # Activate the virtual environment
    # On macOS and Linux:
    source .venv/bin/activate

    # On Windows:
    # .venv\Scripts\activate


## Install Dependencies

With your virtual environment activated, install the required dependencies, including the development tools:

    pip install .
